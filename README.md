* Website needs
    * search bar
    * CMC logo
    * businesses (Name, Owner, Email, Address, Link)
    * filters (products, services, Restaurants, art, health, media and entertainment, athletics, cannabis, personal care, cleaning and maintenance services, real estate and finance)
* Changes Lillian R. wants to make
    * I changed the filters to Art, Athletics, Cleaning & Maitenance Services, Education, Food, Health, Media & Entertainment, Hair & Beauty, Real Estate & Finance, Retail, Other Services
        * I think this works better for the businesses in the list. I will check with brianna but this is an easy change.
